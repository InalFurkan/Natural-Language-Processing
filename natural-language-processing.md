# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR EVERYDAY APPLICATIONS
## 1. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING:
### WHAT IS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of computer science - and more specifically, a branch of artificial intelligence or AI - that aims to enable computers to understand text and spoken words as humans do.
NLP combines computational linguistics - the rule-based modeling of human language - with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies allow computers to process human language in text or speech data and 'understand' the full meaning with the speaker's or writer's intent and emotion.

### WHAT ARE THE BASIC CONCEPTS AND PROCESSES?
Various NLP tasks parse human texts and speech data into pieces that help computers understand what they receive. Some of these tasks include:

# SPEECH RECOGNITION
Also known as speech-to-text, speech recognition is the task of reliably converting speech data into text data. Speech recognition is essential for all applications that follow spoken commands or answer verbal questions. What makes speech recognition particularly challenging is the way people speak - fast, mixing up words, with different emphasis and intonations, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.


# TAGGING - PART OF SPEECH TAGGING
Also known as grammatical tagging, part-of-speech tagging is the process of identifying a part of speech for a particular word or text fragment based on its usage and context. Part-of-speech tagging identifies the word "make" as a verb in the sentence "I can make a paper airplane" and as a noun in the sentence "What make of car do you have?"

# WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION
Word sense disambiguation is the process of selecting the most appropriate meaning of a word with multiple meanings through a semantic analysis process in the given context. For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb 'make' between 'make the grade' (succeed) and 'make a bet' (wager).

# NER - NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
Named Entity Recognition or NER identifies words or phrases as useful entities. NER identifies 'Kentucky' as a location or 'Fred' as a male name.

# TOKENIZATION
The process of breaking characters, words, or subwords into "tokens" that can be analyzed by a program. Tokenization forms the basis of common NLP tasks such as word modeling, building a vocabulary, and frequent word occurrence.

# COREFERENCE RESOLUTION
Coreference resolution is the task of determining whether two words refer to the same entity and when they occur. The most common example is determining the person or object that a specific pronoun refers to (e.g., 'she' = 'Mary'), but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or phrase in the text (e.g., recognizing that 'bear' is not an animal but a big furry human).

# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities from text - attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, doubt.
NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION
Natural language generation is sometimes defined as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it is the task of transforming structured information into human language.

## 2. APPLICATIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE:
### WHAT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION?
Computer speech recognition or speech-to-text, also known as speech recognition, is the ability of a program to convert human speech into written format. Often confused with speech recognition, speech recognition focuses on converting speech from oral format to text format, while speech recognition tries to recognize the intent behind the speech.

### VOICE ASSISTANTS
A voice assistant is an intelligent software that responds to voice commands and can work on any device, including smartphones, speakers, desktop/laptop computers, tablets, wearable devices, game consoles, TV consoles, VR headsets, cars, and Internet of Things devices. Examples include Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana. Voice assistants use artificial intelligence natural language processing technology to interpret human speech and respond with a human-like voice.

### VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEMS
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) is a technology that allows callers to be automatically greeted and directed when they call by phone. This system enables callers to make choices using voice commands or keypad and directs them to the appropriate department or service.
IVR is commonly used in call centers to improve customer service and increase business efficiency.

### SPEECH-TO-TEXT AND DICTATION SYSTEMS
Speech recognition is used to convert spoken text into written text by the user. This can be used to speed up the process of writing or editing text-based documents.
CONFERENCE CALLS AND TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES
Recordings of meetings or conference calls can be converted into text by using speech recognition technology, making it easier to take meeting notes or archive content.

### SECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROL: SPEECH BIOMETRICS AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
Speech biometric authentication verifies that a person is who they say they are by analyzing their unique speech patterns or voiceprints. This technology is often used for security and access control purposes, such as unlocking a smartphone or accessing secure facilities.


## 3. INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS:
NLP USAGE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
The finance and banking sector utilizes NLP for various purposes such as advanced decision-making, automation, and data enrichment. In finance, NLP automates manual processes to transform unstructured data into more usable forms. For instance, NLP facilitates information extraction in financial annual reports, Sentiment Analysis in financial news, ESG and asset management, Sentiment Analysis in tweets about companies, capturing earnings calls, and acquisition announcements. It adds context to unstructured data, making it more searchable and actionable, even automating tedious tasks by reducing human interaction.

Typical applications of NLP in finance include:
### Classification of Financial Documents
Managing financial information in today's fast-paced and complex ecosystem is challenging due to the highly confidential and sensitive nature of data. Various NLP techniques can be employed to classify financial documents.

### Recognition of Financial Assets
NLP helps identify and classify named entities in text, such as persons, locations, dates, numbers, etc., to make recommendations or predictions. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an NLP approach that finds and extracts entities from unstructured textual documents. For example, it can suggest solutions based on news articles about a particular organization.

### Understanding Entities in Context
Understanding Entities in Context refers to the ability to determine whether an entity is mentioned in the present, past, future, negated, current, absent, hypothetical, or probable. For example, significant events and news affecting the value of financial assets can be analyzed using NLP. Financial institutions can understand market sentiments and potential movements in asset prices using text data obtained from news sources and social media platforms.

### Financial analysts can use NLP to analyze large datasets and evaluate factors such as asset valuations, company performance, and economic indicators. This can help them develop more effective investment strategies and provide recommendations to clients. Market news and company reports can be understood using NLP, and this information can be used for risk analysis and evaluation. This enables the identification of potential risk factors in advance and the implementation of risk management strategies.

### Extracting Financial Relationships
Relationship Extraction is the ability to extract whether two entities are related. It helps us extract relationships between a company and its profits, losses, cash flow transactions, etc. Text data is preprocessed before being used to train NLP models. Normalization reduces variations in word forms and improves model performance. When we normalize the text, we reduce randomness and bring it closer to a predefined standard.

### Financial Anonymization
Anonymization is a general term used for any process that eliminates the relationship between a set of identifying data and the data subject. It consists of algorithms and processes that can be applied to documents, records, and data to remove any information that could lead to the identification of the individual. It preserves the privacy of individuals when handled by those who do not need to know their identity.

### Financial Document Segmentation
Segmentation in NLP involves dividing text into smaller units such as sections, paragraphs, sentences, word clusters, etc. For example, we can use NER to identify titles and subtitles in financial documents.

## 4. EMERGING TRENDS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE:
IMPACT OF GPT-3 AND SIMILAR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ON EDUCATION
The use of language models in education has shown tremendous potential. As a powerful tool, language models can provide personalized learning support for students. Models like ChatGPT can generate targeted responses to students' questions, explain complex concepts, or create exercises tailored to their learning levels. Students can learn more effectively and improve their learning experiences. Additionally, language models can serve as a useful tool for teachers, aiding them in managing courses, providing instructional resources, and facilitating effective communication with students.

## INDUSTRY SECTORS
In the business sector, ChatGPT has widespread applications. It can function as an intelligent customer service representative, providing 24/7 service, answering customer queries, and addressing customer requests. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform more complex tasks such as market trend analysis, product recommendations, and content creation. These functions not only help businesses increase efficiency but also provide a better customer experience.

### Healthcare
As an intelligent medical advisory tool, ChatGPT can provide users with health information and advice to better manage their basic health. Similarly, healthcare professionals can use this technology to manage patient records, make diagnosis recommendations, and facilitate effective communication with patients. Examples like these can improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare services.

### Entertainment
ChatGPT has also shown interesting applications in the entertainment industry. For example, it can act as a non-player character in games and provide players with rich interactive experiences. For content creators, ChatGPT can provide creative ideas, inspiring them to write stories, scripts, and even song lyrics.

Alongside these, there could be drawbacks that this technology may bring. Some of them include:
• Generating false or misleading information.
• Enabling misuse of spam, phishing, legal, and governmental processes.
• Allowing for dangerous applications such as writing fake academic papers or social engineering.

Training these language models requires a large amount of data, which may include users' personal information. Ensuring user privacy while using this data is also a significant concern. Additionally, ChatGPT is used to process sensitive information such as medical or personal counseling, so protecting this information from leakage is also crucial.

Due to the potential inclusion of human biases in the training data of ChatGPT and similar models, unintentionally perpetuating and reinforcing these biases is possible. This can lead to biased content based on gender, race, or other forms of bias, thereby affecting the fairness of the model. Identifying and mitigating bias in the model is also one of the challenges faced.

A recent report by Goldman Sachs suggests that artificial intelligence could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs in the US and Europe, as well as a quarter of job tasks. However, the same report also predicts that, similar to previous industrial revolutions, there will be new jobs and a productivity boom.

### 5. CHALLENGES AND ETHICAL ISSUES:
#### TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED IN NLP APPLICATIONS

1. **Language Variations**
   In the United States, most people speak English, but if you're targeting an international and/or multicultural audience, you'll need to provide support for multiple languages. Different languages not only have vastly different vocabularies but also different expression styles, grammatical structures, and cultural expectations. This issue can be addressed using "universal" models that can transfer at least some learning to other languages. However, you'll still need to invest time to retrain your NLP system for each language.

3. **Development Time**
   Similarly, you need to consider the development time for an NLP system. Training an AI typically requires examining millions of data points. If you're using an underpowered computer, processing all this data can take a lifetime. However, with a distributed deep learning model and multiple GPUs working in coordination, you can reduce this training time to just a few hours. Of course, if you're not using existing NLP tools, you'll also need to account for the time required to develop the product from scratch.

4. **Expression Ambiguities**
   Sometimes understanding what someone means when they say something vague can be challenging even for another human. There may not be a clear and concise meaning to be found in a strict analysis of their words. To solve this, an NLP system should be able to seek context to understand the expression. It may also need to ask for clarification from the user.

5. **Spelling Errors**
   Misspellings are a simple problem for humans. We can easily associate a misspelled word with its correctly spelled counterpart and understand the rest of the sentence seamlessly. However, detecting spelling errors can be more challenging for a machine. You need an NLP tool that can recognize common misspellings and go beyond them.

6. **Inherent Biases**
   In some cases, NLP tools may carry biases not only from the programmers but also from the data sets used to train them. Depending on the application, an NLP system may use and/or reinforce certain societal biases or provide a better experience for certain types of users over others. Creating a system that works equally well with all people in all cases is difficult.

7. **Polysemous Words**
   No language is perfect, and most languages have words with multiple meanings. For example, a user asking "how are you?" may have a completely different intention from a user asking a question like "how do I add a new credit card?" Good NLP tools should be able to distinguish between these expressions with the help of context.

8. **Expressions with Multiple Intentions**
   Some expressions and questions actually have multiple purposes, so your NLP system can't oversimplify the situation by interpreting only one of those intentions. For example, a user might ask your chatbot something like "I need to cancel my previous order and update my card on file." Your AI should be able to discern these intentions separately.

9. **False Positives and Uncertainty**
   False positives occur when an NLP system detects an expression that should be understandable and/or actionable but isn't adequately addressed. The solution here is to develop an NLP system that can recognize its limitations and use queries or prompts to dispel uncertainty.

10. **Continuing a Conversation**
    Many modern NLP applications are built around dialogue between a human and a machine. As such, your NLP AI should be able to keep the conversation going, offer additional questions to gather more information, and always point towards a solution.

#### DATA PRIVACY AND ETHICAL ISSUES

**Bias**
One of the most significant ethical concerns about NLP is bias. NLP models are trained on large datasets, and the quality of their outputs depends on the quality and diversity of the data they're trained on. If the training data is biased, an NLP model can learn and perpetuate that bias, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. For example, an NLP-based hiring system could inadvertently discriminate against candidates based on race or gender.

**Privacy**
Another ethical concern with NLP is privacy. NLP systems often rely on large amounts of personal data, such as text messages, emails, and social media posts, to provide insights and make predictions. This data can be sensitive and personal, and individuals may not be aware that it's being collected or used by NLP systems. To protect privacy, it's crucial to design NLP systems with privacy in mind. This includes using data minimization techniques to reduce the amount of personal data collected, providing clear and transparent information about how data is used, and implementing appropriate security measures to protect data from unauthorized access or theft.

**Transparency**
Transparency is also crucial in NLP. Understanding how NLP models arrive at predictions or recommendations is often difficult, leading to distrust and confusion among users. To address this issue, it's essential to ensure that NLP systems are transparent and explainable, providing users with clear documentation and visualizations that help them understand how models make decisions. Misinformation and fake news NLP models can be used to generate fake news and misinformation, which can have serious consequences for society. Developing techniques to detect and filter fake news and misinformation from text data is essential.

**Ownership of Text Data**
Training NLP models requires large amounts of text data, raising questions about the ownership and control of data. Establishing ethical guidelines for the collection, use, and sharing of text data is essential to ensure responsible and transparent practices.

**Surveillance Uses of NLP**
NLP technology can be used to monitor and analyze large volumes of text data, raising concerns about

 privacy and surveillance. Establishing clear rules and regulations for the use of NLP in surveillance is essential to ensure responsible and ethical use.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that includes technical solutions such as data minimization, bias reduction techniques, and explainable AI, as well as broader societal and regulatory changes. Collaboration between developers, governments, and regulators is crucial to ensuring that NLP is developed and used responsibly and ethically. Only then can we fully harness the potential of NLP, minimize risks, and maximize benefits for society as a whole.
